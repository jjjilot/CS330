# CS330
From syllabus:

The primary objective of this course is to become familiar with practical software design and programming activities in a C/C++ and Unix environment. The course does not assume any previous experience with C/C++, but does assume programming experience in other languages. Familiarity with data structures and object oriented programming is assumed. In addition to learning many aspects of the C and C++ languages, we will focus on good programming practices and tools that support them, such as revision control and shell scripting. We will also cover topics in systems, parallel programming, and simple linear algebra. Throughout the course, we will focus on issues of good programming style and practices.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:

  - demonstrate facility using the default Linux shell (bash) including command invocation, IO redirection, file system navigation, environment variables, pipes, and compression and file packaging;
  - describe what occurs at each step of the edit-compile-link-execute cycle of program development;
  - demonstrate the ability to program moderate-sized programs using the C programming language;
  - demonstrate the ability to program moderate-sized programs using the C++ programming language;
  - demonstrate the ability to use gdb and valgrind to find and correct programmatic and memory errors in C programs;
  - demonstrate the ability to translate high-level algorithms to fully functional and bug-free implementations using C and C++.
